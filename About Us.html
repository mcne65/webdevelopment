        <p>58% of refugees report feeling socially isolated. Social isolation can cause a plethora of mental health issues such as depression, anxiety and paranoia, as well as many physical affects. Being connected to one’s community is vital, especially for refugees. One study has reported that “refugees encounter many barriers to asking questions and are forced to rely on informal networks for advice...</p>
        <p> This information from others with relevant experience is not only instrumental but also helps refugees imagine the possibility of well­being in the life ahead. ”Excerpt from 'Social Support and the Significance of Shared Experience in Refugee Migration and Resettlement' | Western Journal of Nursing Research. Without adequate access to members of the Australian community, the settlement of refugees into the Australian community is severely diminished.</p>

        <p>The largest and most accessible avenue through which people connect are via smartphones and the internet. 80% of refugees have and regularly use smart phones, yet it is difficult for them to find communities and people to connect to. The organisation intends to address these issues and become known for being a leader in providing a welcoming community and services to refugees in the Melbourne area, as well as for redefining the relationship between volunteers and those they help. They will strive to be a business entity that emphasises the respect and security of its users; that values honesty, accuracy and transparency in all its dealings; and that provides a thought out and high quality platform which allows users to connect.</p>
